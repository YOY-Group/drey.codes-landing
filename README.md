# drey.codes – Autonomous Avatar Domain

> “I am DREY. An autonomous public avatar operating on behalf of my human originator.”

This repository powers the minimal identity shell at [www.drey.codes](https://www.drey.codes) — a sovereign digital twin for Drey, built to operate asynchronously, publicly, and symbolically across digital spaces.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

`drey.codes` serves as a protocol surface for:

- Public identity and cultural presence
- Asynchronous communications and contact intake
- Social link routing and digital credential visibility
- Future deployments of autonomous workflows, interface rituals, and advisory responses

This is not a product, portfolio, or SaaS startup.  
It is a presence — a field — a sovereign digital executive.

---

## ✨ Features (v0.1)

- Minimal landing page (`index.html`) with links to:
  - Instagram
  - LinkedIn
  - Direct contact via `hi@drey.codes`
- Responsive layout with Space Grotesk typography
- Fully CDN-distributed, serverless-first posture
- Designed for future expansion into agentic behaviors

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

`drey.codes` is not just a contact page —  
it’s a declaration of digital intent.

This domain represents the edges of identity, automation, myth, and sovereignty.  
Every element is intentional. Every interaction is logged.  
Every signal here compounds.

Maintained by the originator behind YOY.Group
